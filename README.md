**I created this Python tool to help companies ensure complete defensive visibility by mapping Wazuh detection rules to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.**  

It helps organizations verify that safeguards exist for every known adversary technique, exposing detection gaps before attackers can exploit them.

---

## 🛡️ Overview
Modern SOC teams manage hundreds of detection rules, yet few know which attack techniques are truly covered.  

**The Wazuh Rule Coverage Analyzer** automates that process by parsing Wazuh rulesets, mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and generating an interactive report that highlights coverage completeness across all stages of an attack.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📂 **Rule Parsing** — Extracts rule IDs, descriptions, and groups from Wazuh XML or JSON files.  
- 🎯 **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** — Correlates rules with ATT&CK tactics and techniques to verify detection scope.  
- 🧠 **Gap Identification** — Highlights uncovered or weakly mapped techniques for immediate improvement.  
- 📊 **Visual Reports** — Generates color-coded HTML and CSV outputs that visualize detection coverage.  
- 🔄 **Continuous Validation** — Can integrate into CI pipelines to monitor detection completeness over time.  

---

## 💡 Why It Matters
Every defensive control should map back to a known adversary behavior.  
This tool gives security teams measurable confidence that their environment is protected across the entire MITRE ATT&CK matrix — ensuring no critical technique is left unmonitored.
